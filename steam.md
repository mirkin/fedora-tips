# Using Steam on Fedora

Steam is primarily targeted at Ubuntu, and isn't quite perfect on Fedora. But we can make it perfect!

Eventually maybe I'll have more useful stuff to say here, but for now, [this guide to Steam on Fedora](http://negativo17.org/steam/) pretty much covers everything. I had some issues with gamepads that were resolved by using the `steam-noruntime` package from that link.
